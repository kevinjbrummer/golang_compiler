# Golang Compiler

## Outline

I had always been interested in the inner workings of programming languages, but the words "interpreter" and "compiler" were just some magic words that made what I type in the text editer turn into a working program.

I had always been hesitent to approach studying this topic, but one day I was recommended Thorsten Ball's *Writing A Compiler In Go*. 

This repository is for the code I wrote while reading the book and my first step in learning about the inner workings of programming languages.

## Additions

Along with what was written in the book, I challenged myself to add some more features.

* comparison operators with <=, >=
* exponentiation with **
* while loops
* string escape literals with \n, \t, \\"
* string concatenation with +
